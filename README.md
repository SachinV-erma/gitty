# Gitty

### Unofficial Client for Ubuntu (*nix)

###### Under development (tomorrow can be different)

Well Github has it's desktop client for Windows and OS X but their is nothing
for *nix. So, I've decided to make one.

Gitty is a Unofficial desktop application build with Electron and using powerful
libraries of node.js . It's under development so only few features are working at
moment but i'm working on it.

Follow the instruction to install developer version
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/sanskar-modi/gitty
$ cd gitty
$ npm install && npm start
```

All suggestions and contributions are welcomed.
